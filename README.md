# Concert Weather Checker

This is a weather checker app that allows the user to check the weather for an upcoming concert they are attending. The data received will firstly gather the date and place for the artist's concert. In turn we can use the date and place to retrieve weather data to then give a forecast.
The search will be stored and displayed in a 'Recent Searches' section.

## Description

This was a group project where we had to design and create a web app that solved a real-world problem. We had to integrate incoming data from at least two server-side APIs.

As this was a collaborative project we had to use agile development and implement features and bug fixes using the git branch workflow, as well as pull requests.

# Useage

The website can be accessed [here](https://philc7.github.io/is-it-dry/).

To use the Concert Weather Checker:

- Using the input box, enter the artist you are going to see.
- Once 'Find Concert' button is pressed, the information for the concert and weather will be displayed.
- This will store the search in localStorage and display it as a card in the 'Recent Searches' section.
- You can repeat this process for another artist of your choice.
- To review a previous search just click on the 'Reload Details' button.

## This is how the page should look.
